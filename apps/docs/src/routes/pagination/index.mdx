# Pagination

A component that enables users to navigate through multiple pages of content with numbered buttons and previous/next controls.

<Showcase name="hero" />

## Basic Usage

To create a pagination component, use the `Pagination.Root` component to wrap `Pagination.Page`, `Pagination.Previous`, and `Pagination.Next` components.

<Showcase name="basic" />

## Navigation Controls

The pagination component includes Previous and Next buttons for easy navigation between pages.

- `Pagination.Previous` - Navigates to the previous page
- `Pagination.Next` - Navigates to the next page

<Showcase name="navigation" />

## Custom Length

The pagination automatically adjusts based on the `totalPages` prop provided to `Pagination.Root`.

<Showcase name="length" />

## Sibling Count

Control how many page numbers appear before and after the current page using the `siblingCount` prop.

<Showcase name="siblings" />

## Ellipsis

When there are many pages, ellipsis (...) is automatically shown to indicate skipped page numbers. You can customize the ellipsis character using the `ellipsis` prop.

<Showcase name="ellipsis" />

## Disabled State

The pagination component handles disabled states:
- Previous button is disabled on the first page
- Next button is disabled on the last page
- Current page button is disabled

<Showcase name="disabled" />

## Keyboard Navigation

The pagination component supports keyboard navigation:
- Left/Right arrows to move between pages
- Home key to jump to first page
- End key to jump to last page

<Showcase name="keyboard" />

## Accessibility

The pagination component is built with accessibility in mind and follows WCAG guidelines:

### ARIA Attributes
- Uses `aria-label="pagination"` on the navigation container
- Each page button includes `aria-current="page"` for the active page
- Previous/Next buttons have descriptive `aria-label` values
- Disabled buttons include `aria-disabled="true"`
