# Intro to QDS

Welcome to the <Sparkles>Qwik Design System</Sparkles> team!

**Qwik Design System** is an open source framework for building *better design systems at scale* with Qwik. From here on, we'll refer to it as QDS.

## What's Included

✨ **A component library of unstyled UI components**  
📚 **A documentation site** to showcase and explain components  
📝 **An automatic documenter** that generates the initial docs and API surface for each component. <br />
🔍 **A testing environment** for ensuring component quality and accessibility

### Coming Soon

🛠️ **A CLI tool** to help you get started with the framework  
🧰 **A set of utilities** specifically designed for building robust design systems

## Prerequisites

Before contributing to QDS, you should be familiar with:

- **[Qwik](https://qwik.dev/)** ⚡: Understanding of Qwik's component model, reactivity system, and optimization techniques

> New to Qwik? Check out this talk by Shai Reznik: [Qwik - Behind The Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3psTl5wqdk)

> Still learning Qwik? Start tackling a couple of [free frontend mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?type=free) to get familiar with the framework.

Nice to haves:

- **Web Accessibility** ♿: Basic understanding of ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation patterns
- **Testing** 🧪: Familiarity with testing tools and strategies

## Principle 1: Headless

A headless UI library is just the brains without the beauty - all the smart functionality with [zero styling](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/you-dont-need-ui-framework/).

- You get the complex behaviors (keyboard navigation, accessibility)
- You add your own styles (colors, spacing, animations)

Think of it as LEGO instructions without dictating what colors to use! 🧩

## Principle 2: Composability

Composability means building complex UIs from simple, reusable pieces that work well together.

For example, instead of a single `<Tooltip>` component with many props, you get:

```jsx
<Tooltip.Root>
  <Tooltip.Trigger>Hover me</Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Tooltip.Content>I appear on hover!</Tooltip.Content>
</Tooltip.Root>
```

This approach gives you more control and flexibility.

Without composability, you face "prop armageddon":

```jsx
<Tooltip
  content="I appear on hover!"
  triggerText="Hover me"
  triggerProps={{ className: "btn", disabled: false }}
  triggerClass="text-blue"
  contentBackgroundColor="#333"
  contentClass="p-2 rounded"
  position="top"
  arrow={true}
  arrowSize={8}
  delay={200}
  // ...and 20 more props
/>
```

This pattern is better for those consuming the library, but not for those building it.

### Composing by abstraction

The purpose of these primitives is for consumers to abstract the complexity of the component, so you can focus on building your app.

```jsx
export const HelpTip = component$(({ trigger }) => {
  return (
    <Tooltip.Root>
      <Tooltip.Trigger asChild>
        {trigger}
      </Tooltip.Trigger>
      <Tooltip.Content class="help-bubble">
        <Slot />
      </Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Root>
  );
});

<form>
  <label>
    Username
    <HelpTip trigger={<Icon name="question-circle" />}>
      Choose a username between 3-20 characters
    </HelpTip>
  </label>
  <input name="username" />
</form>
```

### Composing with your own elements

With the `asChild` prop, you can even replace our default elements with your own:

```jsx
<Tooltip.Root>
  <Tooltip.Trigger asChild>
    <button class="my-custom-button"> 
      Hover me <Icon name="info" />
    </button>
  </Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Tooltip.Content>I appear on hover!</Tooltip.Content>
</Tooltip.Root>
```

> For more on composability, see [this article](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

This lets you maintain your component structure while still getting all the built-in behavior.

## Initial component setup

1. Create a new component folder in the `libs/components/src` directory.
2. Create a new route folder in the `apps/docs/src/routes/` directory.
3. Export the component from the `libs/components/src/index.ts` file.
4. Add the component to the sidebar menu in the `apps/docs/src/routes/menu.md` file.

## Adding docs examples

Every routes folder contains a `examples` folder. This is the place to add new examples for the component.

To add a new example, create a new file in the `examples` folder, and create a Qwik component that does a default export.

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";

export default component$(() => {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
});
```

Then, consume this in the mdx file with the file name as the name of the example.

File tree:

```shell
apps/docs/src/routes/tree/examples/hero.tsx
```

How it looks in MDX:

```mdx
<Showcase name="hero" />
```

## When is a component ready?

A component is ready when it has:

- Research
- Documentation
- Examples
- Tests

### Research

Each folder should have a file called `research.md` or `research.mdx` that outlines the research that went into the component. This should include:

A comprehensive research document should cover the following areas:

#### 

#### Features

List all the features the component should support, using a checklist format:

```md
- [ ] Feature 1
- [ ] Feature 2
- [ ] Feature 3
```

#### Component Structure

Define the composition pieces of the component:

```md
Pieces:
- Root
- Panel
- Handle
```

#### Keyboard Interactions

Document all keyboard interactions the component should support for accessibility:

```md
- Arrow keys for navigation
- Enter/Space for activation
- Escape for dismissal
```

#### ARIA Attributes

List all the ARIA attributes needed for accessibility:

```md
role="dialog"
- aria-labelledby
- aria-describedby
```

#### Use Cases

Document common use cases for the component:

```md
- Forms
- Navigation
- Data visualization
```

#### CSS Considerations

Note any important CSS properties or techniques:

```md
Important CSS:
- position: absolute
- position-anchor: top-left
- overflow: hidden
```

#### API Design

Document the proposed API for each component part:

```md
Root:
- prop1 -> description
- prop2 -> description

Panel:
- propA -> description
- propB -> description
```

#### Known Issues

Document any known issues or challenges from similar implementations:

```md
- Edge case handling
- Browser inconsistencies
```

#### Questions

List any open questions that need resolution:

```md
- How should X behavior work?
- Should we support Y feature?
```

See the [resizable component research](libs/components/src/resizable/research.mdx) for an example.
