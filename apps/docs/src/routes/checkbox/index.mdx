# Checkbox

A control that enables users to make binary (or ternary) choices through selection and deselection.

<Showcase name="hero" />

<AnatomyTable />

## Adding a label

To associate a label with a checkbox, use the `Checkbox.Label` component.

<Showcase name="label" />

## Adding a description

To add a description to a checkbox, add the `isDescription` prop in the `Checkbox.Root` component.

Then use the `Checkbox.Description` component to decide where to render the description.

<Showcase name="description" />

> **Note:** Due to HTML streaming limitations, the `isDescription` prop must be passed to the root component to maintain consistent accessibility across different environments (especially server rendered content). The component will display a warning if no description is provided when this component is rendered.

## Initially check a checkbox

To set a checkbox to its initial checked state, use the `checked` prop.

<Showcase name="initial" />

## Reactive state

To make a checkbox reactive, use the `bind:checked` prop, and pass in a signal.

<Showcase name="reactive" />

## Programmatic state

To make programmatic changes to a checkbox, change a signal value passed to the `bind:checked` prop.

<Showcase name="programmatic" />

## onChange$

To listen for changes when the checkbox state changes, use the `onChange$` prop.

<Showcase name="change" />

## Disabled

To disable a checkbox, use the `disabled` prop.

<Showcase name="disabled" />

## Mixed state

Checkboxes can also be in a third mixed or indeterminate state. This is often considered a "partially checked" state.

To set a mixed state, pass `"mixed"` to the `bind:checked` prop:

<Showcase name="mixed-initial" />

The mixed state can also be set reactively

<Showcase name="mixed-reactive" />

> When a checkbox is in a mixed state and the user clicks it:
> 1. The first click changes the state from "mixed" to "checked"
> 2. The next click changes the state from "checked" to "unchecked"
> 
> This follows the standard accessibility pattern where mixed → checked → unchecked → checked → unchecked, and so on.

## Inside a form

To create a form with a checkbox, use the `Checkbox.HiddenNativeInput` component.

<Showcase name="form" />

Then create a name for the checkbox in the `Checkbox.Root` component.

> This will be used to associate the checkbox with the form.

## Making a checkbox required

To make a checkbox required, pass `required` to the `Checkbox.Root` component.

<Showcase name="required" />

## Giving a checkbox a value

By default, the value of a checkbox is `on` when checked. To give a checkbox a distinct value, pass a string to the `value` prop.

<Showcase name="value" />

## Checkbox validation

To validate a checkbox, use the `Checkbox.ErrorMessage` component. Whenever this component is rendered, the checkbox will display a validation error message.

> Screen readers will announce the error message when the component is rendered, along with an indication that the checkbox is invalid.

<Showcase name="validation" />
