# Checkbox

A control that enables users to make binary (or ternary) choices through selection and deselection.

## Adding a label

To associate a label with a checkbox, use the `Checkbox.Label` component.

<Showcase name="label" />

## Initially check a checkbox

To set a checkbox to its initial checked state, use the `checked` prop.

<Showcase name="initial" />

## Reactive state

To make a checkbox reactive, use the `bind:checked` prop, and pass in a signal.

<Showcase name="reactive" />

## Programmatic state

To make programmatic changes to a checkbox, change a signal value passed to the `bind:checked` prop.

<Showcase name="programmatic" />

## onChange$

To listen for changes when the checkbox state changes, use the `onChange$` prop.

<Showcase name="change" />

## Disabled

To disable a checkbox, use the `disabled` prop.

<Showcase name="disabled" />

## Mixed state

Checkboxes can also be in a third mixed or indeterminate state. This is often considered a "partially checked" state.

To set a checkbox to an initial mixed state, use the `mixed` prop.

<Showcase name="mixed-initial" />

The mixed state can also be set reactively

<Showcase name="mixed-reactive" />
