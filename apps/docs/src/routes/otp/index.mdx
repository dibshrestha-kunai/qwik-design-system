# OTP Input

A control that enables users to enter one-time passwords or verification codes with individual character inputs.

<Showcase name="hero" />

## Initially Setting an OTP

To configure an initial state for the OTP, use either the "value" prop or the "bind:value" prop if you already have a signal.

<Showcase name="initial" />

## Reactive State

Make the OTP reactive by binding its value to a signal. Any changes to that signal will be reflected, and user input will also update the signal.

<Showcase name="reactive" />

## Disabled

Disable user interaction by passing the "disabled" prop to the root component. This will disable the hidden native input and prevent further user input.

<Showcase name="disabled" />

## onChange$

Use the "onChange$" prop on the root to listen for changes as the user types. This is called for each keystroke or edit.

<Showcase name="change" />

## onComplete$

When the user has filled in all required characters, the OTP is considered "complete." The "onComplete$" prop can be used to trigger any final logic (e.g., auto-submitting).

<Showcase name="complete" />

## Adding a Caret

To show a caret (like a blinking cursor) on the active input position, include the Otp.Caret component inside each Otp.Item. The caret appears only on the focused, empty position.

{/* <Showcase name="caret" /> */}

## Hidden Native Input

The OTP input features a hidden native input for accessibility and mobile keyboards. Ensure you include it by placing Otp.HiddenInput inside your Otp.Root.

{/* <Showcase name="native" /> */}

## Numeric Input

By default, the hidden input is configured to accept numbers (inputMode="numeric" and pattern="[0-9]*"). This prompts numeric keyboards on mobile devices. You can override this if you need alphanumeric codes.

{/* <Showcase name="numeric" /> */}

## Custom Length

The length of the OTP is determined by the number of Otp.Item components. Add or remove items to change the length.

{/* <Showcase name="length" /> */}

## Focus Management

The component automatically manages focus. Clicking any Otp.Item focuses the hidden input, and the caret or highlight will track the currently active position.

{/* <Showcase name="focus" /> */}

## Full Entry State

When all characters are filled, the component enters a "full" state. You can use this for styling or to trigger further logic, such as validation or auto-submission.

{/* <Showcase name="full" /> */}

## Inside a Form

When using the OTP within a form, include the Otp.HiddenInput with a "name" prop. This links the collected code to form submissions.

{/* <Showcase name="form" /> */}

## Accessibility

• A hidden native input helps ensure screen readers announce the OTP properly.  
• Default aria-label of "Enter your OTP" is used (customizable through props).  
• Keyboard interactions are preserved, including arrow keys, Shift+arrow range selection, and pasting.  
• Disabled state is exposed with proper attributes for assistive technologies.
