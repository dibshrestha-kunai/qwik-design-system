# State

QDS components have two types of state:

1. Signal based
2. Value based

## Signal based (two-way binding)

Consumers can pass a signal directly to the component to manage the component's state.

```tsx
export const ExampleComp = component$(() => {
    const selectedValueSig = signal(null);

    return (
        <Select.Root bind:value={selectedValueSig}>
            {...}
        </Select.Root>
    )
})
```

`bind:value` under the hood is a really just a prop. The convention is to use `bind:` for signals, to stay consistent with Qwik's convention.

> In Qwik, you can use `bind:value` or `bind:checked` to pass your own signal state to inputs for example.

When using this pattern, its expected that both the internal state of the component and the consumer's signal are in sync.

### useBoundSignal

Qwik Design System provides a hook to combine signals to one source of truth.

```tsx
export const SelectRoot = component$((props: SelectRootProps) => {
    const {
        "bind:value": givenSelectedValueSig,
        value,
        ...rest
    } = props;

    const selectedValueSig = useBoundSignal(givenSelectedValueSig, "Jim");

    return (
        <div>
            <Slot />
        </div>
    )
})
```

The first argument is the **signal that the consumer passed in**. The second argument is the **initial value** of the signal.

In this case we've provided the initial value of `"Jim"` to the signal, but it could be an initial value from a prop passed by the consumer as well from value based state.
