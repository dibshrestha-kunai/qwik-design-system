# Composition

## What is Composability?

Composability is a design principle where complex UI components are built from simple, reusable pieces that work well together. In QDS, components are designed to be composed rather than configured through numerous props.

For example, instead of a monolithic component with many configuration options, QDS provides component parts that you can combine:

```jsx
<Tooltip.Root>
  <Tooltip.Trigger>Hover me</Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Tooltip.Content>I appear on hover!</Tooltip.Content>
</Tooltip.Root>
```

This approach gives you more flexibility and control over your UI components.

## One Component, One Markup Element

A key principle in QDS is that each component typically corresponds to ONE piece of markup. With few exceptions, components are responsible for rendering and controlling a single element in the DOM.

This principle:

- Keeps components focused on a single responsibility
- Makes the relationship between components and DOM clearer
- Simplifies styling and accessibility implementations
- Avoids "div soup" and unnecessary nesting

The exceptions to this rule are primarily composite components that need to manage multiple elements as a cohesive unit, like dialogs with backdrops or components that need to manage focus traps.

By following these composition principles, QDS aims to provide a flexible foundation that can be adapted to any design system needs while maintaining accessibility and performance.
