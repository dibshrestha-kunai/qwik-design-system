# Research

Each component folder should have a file called `research.md` or `research.mdx` that outlines the research that went into the component. This should include:

A comprehensive research document should cover the following areas:

## Features

List all the features the component should support, using a checklist format:

```md
- [ ] Feature 1
- [ ] Feature 2
- [ ] Feature 3
```

As you add features, make sure to update the research document to reflect the latest changes.

## Component Structure

Define the composition pieces of the component:

```md
Pieces:
- Root
- Panel
- Handle
```

## Keyboard Interactions

Document all keyboard interactions the component should support for accessibility:

```md
- Arrow keys for navigation
- Enter/Space for activation
- Escape for dismissal
```

## Attributes

List all the attributes needed for the component to work or be accessible:

```md
role="dialog"
- aria-labelledby
- aria-describedby
```

## Use Cases

Document common use cases for the component:

```md
- Forms
- Navigation
- Data visualization
```

Provide links to the example use cases.

For example, here's some use case links of the slider component:

- [Image Reveal slider](https://examples.motion.dev/js/image-reveal-slider)
- [iOS Slider](https://examples.motion.dev/js/ios-slider)

## CSS Considerations

Note any important CSS properties or techniques:

```md
Important CSS:
- position: absolute
- position-anchor: top-left
- overflow: hidden
```

## API Design

Document the proposed API for each component part:

```md
Root:
- prop1 -> description
- prop2 -> description

Panel:
- propA -> description
- propB -> description
```

## Known Issues

Document any known issues or challenges from similar implementations:

```md
- Edge case handling
- Browser inconsistencies
```

## Questions

List any open questions that need resolution:

```md
- How should X behavior work?
- Should we support Y feature?
```
