# Philosophy

Everything should be HTML and CSS until users *actually* care about it (with a few exceptions).

Have you ever been on a janky site and it took so long to load that you just gave up and left?

Chances are, that application is iterating through the tree, setting up a bunch of initialization logic that is never used.

The idea is we want to do **less work**, and only the work that is actually needed.

## Code should be optimized for the environment

It's very common to see code that is optimized *only* for the browser. (React, Vue, Svelte)

On the other hand, it's also very common to see code that is optimized *only* for the server. (PHP, Ruby, WordPress)

What if we **didn't have to re-invent the wheel** for each component in each environment? And those components actually **got the benefits** of the environment they're running in?

QDS components are designed to be **optimized for the environment** they're running in, down to the function and event level.

## Thinking in terms of interactions

To users, components don't exist. All they see is a button they can click. Code should execute in response to those interactions.

When that click happens, the *only* code that actually runs is the **event handler**.

Even visible tasks are events, under the hood it is an internal event called `qvisible`. The event code runs when the parent element is visible in the user's viewport.

### Delay the execution of code until it's needed
