# Headless Pagination Component

## Todo Items

1. Create a core pagination function that handles page calculations and state management.

2. Implement keyboard navigation support for accessibility.

3. Develop a flexible API that allows customization of the number of visible pages and sibling pages.

4. Create helper functions for generating page ranges and handling bounded/unbounded sets.

5. Implement event handlers for page changes and navigation.

## Requirements

1. Support both controlled and uncontrolled usage modes.

2. Provide a way to set the total number of items and items per page.

3. Allow customization of the current page, either through props or state.

4. Implement proper ARIA attributes for accessibility, including `aria-current="page"` for the current page.

5. Support navigation to first, previous, next, and last pages.

6. Handle ellipsis (overflow) indicators for pages that are not displayed.

7. Ensure the component works with both bounded (known total pages) and unbounded (unknown total pages) sets.

## Nice-to-have Features

1. Internationalization support for labels like "Previous", "Next", etc.

2. Performance optimization for large datasets.

3. Support for different pagination layouts (e.g., compact, expanded).

4. Ability to customize the number of items shown per page.

5. Animation support for page transitions.

6. Server-side rendering compatibility.

7. Support for dynamic page size changes.

8. Ability to jump to a specific page number.

9. Event callbacks for pagination actions (e.g., onPageChange, onNextPage, onPreviousPage).

## Pagination API's

Potential API's:

- `count`: Total number of items to paginate
- `page`: Current page (for controlled usage)
- `defaultPage`: Initial page (for uncontrolled usage)
- `onPageChange`: Callback fired when the page changes
- `perPage`: Number of items per page
- `siblingCount`: Number of always visible pages before and after the current page
- `showFirstLast`: Whether to show first and last page buttons
- `boundaryCount`: Number of pages to show at the beginning and end
