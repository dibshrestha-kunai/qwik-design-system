API's

Root:

orientation

onChange$ -> fires when one of the handles is moved

disabled -> disable resizing

Panel:

width or height prop, and that affects their styles in css.

CSS determines layout allocation

maxWidth -> max size
minWidth -> min size

collapseTo -> size when collapsed
collapseAt -> when to collapse

onCollapseChange$ -> fired when collapse changes

Handle:

step -> how far each handle or resize should go

onResizeStart$ -> starts moving

onResize$ -> called when handle is moved

onResizeEnd$ -> stopped moving

asChild on all

snap -> rather than dragging, it snaps to a certain size
